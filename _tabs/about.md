I'm a researcher building a non-invasive BCI and this site is mostly to document the developement of the project. BCI is hyper-interdisciplinary(Neuroscience, electrical engineering, human factors, signal processing, machine-learning, biomedical...) so development is slowed by me having to learn a lot. The benefit of that is that it's enlessly interesting and I can document and share the process of me figuring things out.

### Prior knowledge & lack thereof

| Knowlegeable                      | Learning          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------  |
| Neuro/Electrophysiology           | ML                |
| Human Factors                     | E. Engineering    |
| Hardware & Software               | CUDA              |
| Signal Processing methods         | Anything remotely invasive lol

I hope to inprove this obviosly but that is the skill set and perspective I currently have. Everything about the project itself I plan put over in the **Dev Blog**
