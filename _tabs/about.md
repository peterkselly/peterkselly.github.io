I'm a researcher building a non-invasive BCI and this site is mostly to document the developement of the project. BCI is hyper-interdisciplinary(Neuroscience, electrical engineering, human factors, signal processing, machine-learning, biomedical...) so development is slowed by me having to learn a lot. The benefit of that is that it's enlessly interesting and I can document and share the process of me figuring things out.

By the way, I recognize that public conciousness of BCI is pretty weak aside from fluff-pieces that only really say how cool BCIs theoretically will become.. eventually. I will try to provide helpful resources and avoid technical language where possible but some of what I document will inevitably be hard to interpret. This is not a formal document, I will not be referencing every paper or resource.

I hope to inprove this obviosly but this is the skill set and perspective I started this project with. Everything about the project itself I plan put over in the **Dev Blog**


My experience is in working in Neuroscience and human factors labs as a post-baccalaureate. But here is brief outline of the two major projects that inform what I know now:

| Project Name             | Brief Discription       | Prinicpal Methods Involved          | P.I.                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------  | ------------------------------------|---------------------- |
| LEARNER Project          | Developing an adaptive training <br>platform for mass-casulty triage <br>and patient handling tasks using <br>XR.                  | AR & VR, exoskeletons               | Dr. Ranjana Mehta     |
| R01 Longitudinal Study  | Tracking longitudinal changes in <br>cerebello-cortical networks and <br>function across the adult lifespan.                       | MRI, Cognitive & behavioral testing | Dr. Jessica Bernard   |
