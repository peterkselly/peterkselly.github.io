### Pipeline

The job of the hardware is really simple. It has to get the data from the electrodes to the computer in a way that is organized and can function continuously. The difficulty is in designing the circuitry to process the incredibly weak input signals (look to the post I made about EEG limitations for more info). Weak analog signals are subject to noise 

There are only 3 principal components.
