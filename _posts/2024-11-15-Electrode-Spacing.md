#### Location and density

Keeping in mind the limitations of EEG, we are putting our electrode array over the **hand knob region** of the motor cortex

hexagonal spacing
- consistent distance between electrodes
- scalable
Chosen density was based on what was reasonable for target area
Considerations for reference
- compare ia taking nearest electrode vs. earlobe
- modularity
